SHORT DESCRIPTION
    DSC Composite Resources for Microsoft 365 management with PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC).

LONG DESCRIPTION
    DscConfig.M365 provides an abstraction layer between the Microsoft365DSC resources
    and the deployment framework in Microsoft365DscWorkshop. It creates DSC composite resources
    from the Microsoft365DSC resources to simplify configuration management and
    deployment of Microsoft 365 resources.

    The module dynamically generates DSC composite resources (prefixed with 'c') for
    each Microsoft365DSC resource. It creates two types of composite resources:

    - Scalar resources - For singleton resources (with IsSingleInstance property)
    - Array resources - For resources that can have multiple instances    This module is part of a complete solution that requires:
    - Microsoft365DSC - The underlying DSC resource module for Microsoft 365
    - Microsoft365DscWorkshop - The deployment framework for managing configurations

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Import-Module DscConfig.M365
    PS C:\> Get-DscResource -Module DscConfig.M365

    # Example usage in a configuration:
    PS C:\> configuration M365Config {
    >>     Import-DscResource -ModuleName DscConfig.M365
    >>     node localhost {
    >>         cAADSecurityDefaults SecurityDefaults {
    >>             IsSingleInstance = 'Yes'
    >>             IsEnabled        = $true
    >>             TenantId         = 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
    >>             Credential       = $Credential
    >>         }
    >>     }
    >> }
